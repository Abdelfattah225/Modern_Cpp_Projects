# Modern_C++_Projects

ðŸš€ Welcome to the Modern C++ Projects repository! ðŸŽ‰  

This repository serves as a hub for my journey in learning and mastering Modern C++ (C++11, C++14, C++17, and beyond). It contains a variety of projects and exercises designed to explore key concepts, tools, and techniques in Modern C++ development.  

## What's Inside?  
- **Hands-on exercises** to practice STL, algorithms, and containers.  
- **Practical projects** like managing bakery orders, building parsers, and more.  
- **Advanced concepts** such as smart pointers, lambdas, multithreading, and move semantics.  

Each project is organized in a separate folder with its own explanation and source code. Feel free to explore, clone, and experiment!
