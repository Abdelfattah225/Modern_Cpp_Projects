# ECALL Emergency Response System

## Project Overview
The **ECALL Emergency Response System** is a simulated project that detects vehicle accidents and sends emergency notifications. The system applies **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles, **Modern C++ features**, and incorporates **basic networking and file handling techniques**.

## Features & Functionalities
### 1️⃣ **Vehicle Monitoring & Accident Detection**
- **Vehicle Class**: Stores properties like **speed, location, and acceleration**.
- **Accident Detection Algorithm**: Detects accidents based on sudden deceleration (e.g., a rapid drop in speed to zero).
- **ECALL System**: Initiates emergency procedures when an accident is detected.

### 2️⃣ **Emergency Notification System**
- **NotificationService Class**: Sends accident notifications via **SMS and Email**.
- **Remote Server Communication**: Simulates sending real-time data (vehicle location, time of accident, etc.) to emergency responders.
- **Retry Mechanism**: Ensures notifications are delivered successfully.

### 3️⃣ **OOP Concepts Implementation**
- **Encapsulation**: Private variables for vehicle properties with public getters and setters.
- **Inheritance**: Different vehicle types (e.g., Car, Truck) with unique accident detection behaviors.
- **Polymorphism**: Handling various notification types (SMS, Email) dynamically.

### 4️⃣ **Modern C++ Features Used**
- **Smart Pointers** (`std::unique_ptr`, `std::shared_ptr`) for memory management.
- **Lambda Functions** for event handling (e.g., logging messages, triggering alerts).
- **STL Containers** (`std::vector`, `std::map`) to manage multiple vehicles and their ECALL systems.

### 5️⃣ **Data Management & Logging**
- **Accident Log File**: Stores vehicle ID, accident time, speed, and location in **JSON/CSV** format.
- **Reload Functionality**: Allows loading past accidents for analysis.

### 6️⃣ **Terminal-Based Simulation**
- **Mock Data Entry**: Users input speed, location, and acceleration through the terminal.
- **Automated Accident Simulation**: Users provide sequences of speed/acceleration values to test the system.
- **Real-time Feedback**: Displays vehicle status and triggers ECALL on accident detection.

### 7️⃣ **Optional Enhancements**
- **Networking using Sockets**: Simulates ECALL notifications being sent to a remote server.
- **Observer Design Pattern**: Notifies system components when an accident occurs.
- **Mock GPS System**: Generates realistic vehicle location data.
